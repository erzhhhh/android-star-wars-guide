# Star Wars Guide

A small, fun Star Wars app built in Kotlin — meant to practice networking, lists, and a bit of UI polish while geeking out over the galaxy 👽✨

## What this app does
- Pulls Star Wars data (people, planets, starships — you name it)
- Shows it in a clean list UI
- Lets you tap items to see more details
- Handles loading / errors without drama

## Tech behind the scenes
- **Kotlin** (of course)
- **Android Jetpack** bits
- **RecyclerView** for lists
- **ViewModel + LiveData** for state
- **Retrofit** for network calls
- **Coroutines** for async work


## Getting started
1. Clone the repo
2. Open it in Android Studio
3. Sync Gradle
4. Run it on a device/emulator — you’re good 🚀

_No API keys needed._

## Data source
Everything comes from the public Star Wars API:
